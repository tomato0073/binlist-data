# Repo closed

I no longer have the time or desire to continue updating and moderating this repository, and it is now read-only. You can fork this and continue your own database.

# Open-source BIN list

This repository is an open-source list of Issuer Identification Numbers (IIN), which are more commonly known as a Bank Identification Number (BIN).

The leading 6-8 numbers of a credit or debit card are used to identify the issuing bank or financial institution. This repo has been compiled by scraping, organising and compiled data from many different sources and is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Using the list

You are free to use this list for any purpose, including private or commercial use.

**This data is not an official IIN register.** I scraped and compiled this data to help with learning Python, and although it is a fairly comprehensive and accurate BIN list, it's not perfect. Use at your own risk!


## Contributing

The easiest way is to fork this repository on GitHub, modify existing lines, or add your own, and then submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). If you could quote a source link or text with your commit message, it'll help me to verify the data and include your submission in the list.
